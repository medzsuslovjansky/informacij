## Summary.

This article is looking into possibilities of the git repositories for the code and the documentation connected to Interslavic language, published as open source under benevolent license.

## What is Git

Git is fast, efficient and reliable distributed version control system. Today, it is de facto standard for keeping the versioned code and other content.

## What is GitHub

GitHub is the internet service with the web interface for storing public git repositories. URL of the service is https://github.com.
The main benefit for registered users is the easy cooperation in repositories not owned by them. Also, you can create organizations on GitHub, with many members permitted to work with the content of the repository.
Another feature that comes to mind, is the ease with which is possible to host web pages straight from GitHub.

## What is the proposal

There is already a lot of code and documentation on the topic of the Interslavic language. All this content will be stored under the Interslavic organization in dedicated repositories. This has the benefit of having it publicly visible on the very popular service (at least with developers) and easy correction and changes by any GitHub users.

## Types of content

There are many types of content, storable on the GitHub. Please take these mentioned here only as the starting point for the future exploration.

### Dictionaries

The dictionaries will be stored both in open formats like JSON or XML, but also in the form of ready-made computer programmes. Those dictionaries then will be crosslinked between opposing languages. Also, those dictionaries do not have to be only for human consumption, but also the ones used in computer programs for internationalization.

### Corpus of the language

All written texts will be stored in open formats, preferably readable by humans such as Markdown or Org. This will have the advantage for text machine processing, for machine learning or artificial intelligence. There are already many tools in programming languages prepared for the usage within GitHub ecosystem.

### Code of the programs and web pages

Thanks to the main profession of the creator of Interslavic language there is already a lot of code, which is strictly directed at it. For example grammar helper programs or web pages. All the code will be stored here, so other people will have a chance to make it better.

### Technical guides

One of the most interesting usages will be the creation of technical documentation in the Interslavic language for various areas like programming languages, design or hardware specifications. Those will be tailored mostly for the use by the newcomers to the technology and not as detailed documentation, which usually exists in the sufficient volume in the English language.
This is the main goal of the project and we will discuss it more in the upcoming article.

## Interslavic organization on GitHub

There is already medzsuslovjansky organization on the GitHub, with one repository for the basic information. You can find this article in the repository. The address is https://github.com/medzsuslovjansky. Please feel free to contact the author of this article for the invitation.

## Conclusion

Creation of the active Interslavic organization on GitHub can benefit the spread and betterment of the Interslavic language in the technical circles.
