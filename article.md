## Summary.

This article is looking into possibilities of the creation of the git repository of code and documentation connected to Interslavic language, published as open source under benevolent license.

## What is GitHub

GitHub is the internet service with the web interface on which anyone can create public git repositories. It is also possible to create private ones, but it's not within the scope of this article. Service could be found at the address https://github.com.
What is the main benefit of this service, is that when you have registered user there, it is quite easy to cooperate on the code in repositories not owned by you. There is also chance to create Organizations on GitHub, which could have many members with permissions to work with the content of the repository.

## What is the proposal

There is already a lot of code and especially documentation on the topic of the Interslavic language. All this content could be also stored under the Interslavic organization in dedicated repositories. This has not only benefit of having it publicly visible on the very popular service (at least with developers), but also the benefit of easy correction and changes by any of the registered users of the service. Another feature that comes to mind, is the ease with which is possible to host web pages straight from GitHub.

## Types of content

There many types of content, which could be stored on the GitHub, those mentioned here should be taken only as the starting point for future exploration of possibilities.

### Dictionaries

The dictionaries will be stored both in open formats like JSON or XML, but also in the form of ready-made computer programmes. Those dictionaries then could be crosslinked between opposing languages. Also, those dictionaries do not have to be only human ones, but also the ones used in the computer programs for internationalization.

### Corpus of the language

All written texts could be stored the in open formats, preferably human readable like Markdown or Org. This will have the advantage for machine processing of the texts for purposes like machine learning or artificial language (which is one of the very good usages of the language in the eyes of the author) because there are already many tools in many programming languages prepared for the cooperation with the GitHub ecosystem.

### Code of the programs and web pages

Thanks to the main profession of the creator of Interslavic language there is already a lot of code, which is strictly directed at it. Be it grammar helper programs, web pages or many others. All the code could be stored here, so other people could cooperate and make it better.

### Technical guides

One of the most interesting usages will be the creation of technical documentation in the Interslavic language for various areas like programming languages, design or hardware specifications. Those will be tailored mostly for the use by the newcomers to the technology and not as detailed documentation, which usually exists in the sufficient volume in the English language. 

## Conclusion

Creation of the active Interslavic organization on GitHub could have many benefits for the spread and betterment of the Interslavic language in the more technical circles.
